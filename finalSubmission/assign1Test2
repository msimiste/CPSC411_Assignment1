% Purpose: This set of tests will test for proper parsing of the keywords
% 			ie if, then, while, do, input....etc
% 			since single line comments must be included they are also tested as an added bonus
% Date: January 28, 2016

% these tests show that the compiler can handle special characters within an ID value
s! 											% this should give the ID s!
s3 											% this should give the ID s3
s!3 										% this should give the ID s!3
s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&&&34aht				% this is a legitimate ID if we are allowing special characters
											% to be included as well as the $alpha[$alpha$digit]* combination
