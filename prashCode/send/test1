comments 
if 
then
while

:= 5

/*   %testing*/


begin
  x:=1;  % set x to 1!
  y:=2;   /*
  z:=3;  
         % the really tricky thing is that 
         % if I close a multiline comment, */ thus  in a 
         % line comment it does not count!
end

/* yet more comments

   v:= w-3;

 **********/

 /*
    Testing!!!   % skip
*/
A   % output should just be A
